The Classic Problem:
A farmer has to get a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain across a river.
He has a small boat which can only carry him and one other item.
* To get across the river, the farmer must be in the boat (the fox, chicken and bag can't operate a boat's oars!)
* If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken.
* If the chicken and the bag of grain are left together, the chicken will eat the grain.
* If the fox and the bag of grain are left together, they are safe (the fox won't eat the grain.)
How does the farmer get the fox, chicken and bag of grain across the river without something getting eaten?
Solution:
1. The farmer and the chicken cross the river, leaving the chicken on the other side.
2. The farmer goes back across the river, on his own.
3. The farmer then takes the fox across the river.
4. He can't leave the fox and chicken together, so he brings the chicken back.
5. Again, since the chicken and grain can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.
6. He then returns to pick up the chicken.
7. Finally, he heads across the river one last time, with the chicken.
Kata:
Write a program which can work out which item should be taken across the river next.
As the program iterates, show the progress of the farmer taking the fox, chicken and grain across the river.
